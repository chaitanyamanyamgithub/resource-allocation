## 🛠️ Steps Involved in Solving the Problem

1. **Preprocessing**: Resources are sorted based on priority factors (e.g., demand, availability).
2. **Divide & Conquer Optimization**: The dataset is split, and recursive allocation is performed.
3. **Greedy Selection Refinement**: The best resource is assigned based on real-time constraints.
4. **Dynamic Adjustment**: The allocation is fine-tuned based on feedback, ensuring optimal resource utilization.
5. **Final Validation**: The assigned resources are evaluated using efficiency metrics like execution time and utilization rate.

# 📐 Mathematical Formulation of T(n)
The recurrence relation is:
T(n) = aT(n/b) + O(f(n)), where:
a = number of subproblems,
b = size reduction,
f(n) = merging cost.
For our algorithm, a = 2, b = 2, f(n) = O(n), leading to:
T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)

Using Master’s Theorem (Case 2):
T(n) = O(n log n).

## 🔬 Master’s Theorem Analysis
Identify Recurrence Relation: Given T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n),
where a = 2, b = 2, f(n) = O(n).
Apply Master’s Theorem:
Compute O(n<sup>log₂2</sup>) = O(n<sup>1</sup>) = O(n).
Since f(n) = O(n), which is equal to O(n<sup>log₂2</sup>), we use Case 2 of the Master's Theorem.
Determine Time Complexity:
According to Case 2, the time complexity is O(n<sup>log₂b</sup> log n) = O(n<sup>log₂2</sup> log n) = O(n log n). This makes the algorithm efficient and scalable.
